# Sign a Petition Online and Explain Why on Github

https://www.change.org/p/join-the-revolution-make-healthy-foods-accessible-to-all

I signed this petition for a number of reasons. First, obesity is becoming a serious problem in the United States, and a big part that is causing it is something called "food deserts." (Which means families do not have easy access to healthy and fresh food.) I believe that everyone should have an equal chance to healthy food. Second, this petition also mentions specifically having organic food. This is also something important to me, as growing organic food is much less harmful on the environment, eating organic food is much healthier, and I want to encourage the government to give more subsidies to organic farms. Signing my name on this petition is one small way of doing so.
