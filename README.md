# Sign a Petition Online and Explain Why on Github

https://www.change.org/p/join-the-revolution-make-healthy-foods-accessible-to-all

I signed this petition for a number of reasons. First, obesity is becoming a serious problem in the United States, and a big part that is causing it is something called "food deserts." (Which means families do not have easy access to healthy and fresh food.) I believe that everyone should have an equal chance to healthy food. Second, this petition also mentions specifically having organic food.
